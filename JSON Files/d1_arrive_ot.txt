You listen to the news as you drive to work:
'NewVision announces new environmental goals in response to increasing protests!'

You make it to work. Someone meets you at the front desk and takes you to your desk.
She says she is Dirk’s assistant.

Dirk’s an old friend who recommended the job. He’s the project manager and was quite
enthusiastic about this Data Centre last time you spoke.

You spend a while settling in and signing in to all the systems before Dirk comes to 
your desk, 
'Hey mate, it's great to see you! I'm so glad corporate decided to hire you,
you're just the person I need for this role! Can I count on your 100% commitment
to getting this project over the line?'

How do you respond?
